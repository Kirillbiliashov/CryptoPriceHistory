# CryptoPriceHistory
This project is a simple Android app that displays crypto price history in a list. The project does not contain complex logic and it is not ready-to-use production app. 
The main goal is to get paging data from API and store it in cache using Retrofit, Room and Paging library.
So consider it as fully implemented paging functionality for API data, no more no less.
